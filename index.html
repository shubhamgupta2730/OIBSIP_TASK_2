          <h2>Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons and Tata Group</h2>
          <p>
            Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian Industrialist
            and former chairman of Tata Sons. He was also the chairman of the
            Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman from
            October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its
            charitable trusts. In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the
            second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma
            Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.
            <br />
            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of
            Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
            Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree
            in architecture. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop
            floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman
            of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure
            the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an
            attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a
            global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in
            the world, having donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.

          <h3>Know About RATAN TATA</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ratan Tata is a name to reckon with in the annals of Tata Group's
              business. Although he is one of the most influential businessmen
              in India, he is best known for his simplicity and loneliness, and
              the words used most often to describe Ratan Tata are 'shy' and
              'loner."
            </li>
            <li>
              During his 21 years of tenure as the Chairman of Tata Group
              (1991-2012), revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50
              times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ratan Tata, in many ways, is an accidental millionaire. He is, in
              fact, a gifted interloper, who, even after heading one of the
              biggest business conglomerates in India, lives an ordinary life
              and shuns the media spotlight. This quiet and humble Indian
              business tycoon drives himself to work in a Tata sedan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although the Tatas had built up a formidable business by 1971, the
              family was running out of heirs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ratan's father, Naval H Tata was born into an ordinary family in
              Surat. Naval's parents died when he was too young; leaving him to
              be raised at an orphanage, but Naval was destined to win life's
              lottery and at 13. Naval was adopted by Lady Navajbai Tata (Tata's
              formidable matriarch); who had been left childless and widowed at
              40. Thereafter, Naval rose to become the deputy chairman of the
              Tata Group.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ratan is, in fact, a Tata by birth; as his biological maternal
              grandmother was the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder
              Jamsetji Tata. Moreover, his biological grandfather, Hormusji
              Tata, also belonged to the broader Tata Family.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unlike the Ratan Tata's present-day lifestyle of an ordinary
              person, he spent his childhood in luxury; as he grew up at Tata
              Palace, a white Baroque revival-style building in the centre of
              Mumbai; attended by a crew of 50 servants. Reportedly, Ratan was
              driven to school in a Rolls-Royce.
            </li>
            <li>
              While growing up, Ratan became very close to his grandmother, Lady
              Navajbai Tata. While talking about his grandmother in an
              interview, he said,
            </li>
            <li>
              I owe a great deal to my grandmother who brought up my brother and
              me. She instilled in us what she considered to be proper, And I
              think that has had a very profound influence on me and my value
              systems."
